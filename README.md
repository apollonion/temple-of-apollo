# temple-of-apollo
Temple of Apollo is a website for experimenting with FaceDev's Gurted project <br/>
I have less than zero experience with HTML and CSS, and have marginal experience on Lua (albeit through the form of Luau on Roblox) <br/>
I have this GitHub repository so I can host the website on GitHub instead of trudging through the hurdles and security risks of hosting on my own PC
